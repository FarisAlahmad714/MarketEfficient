I've successfully added leaderboard ranking badges to user profiles! Here's what was implemented:

### 🎯 **New Features**

**2. Dynamic Ranking Badges**
- **Location**: Enhanced `ProfileHeader.js` component
- **Visual**: Color-coded badges based on ranking percentile

- **Responsive**: Adapts to mobile screens

### 🏅 **Badge Ranking System**

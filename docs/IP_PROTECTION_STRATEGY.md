## Implementation Timeline

### Immediate (0-2 weeks):
1. Document all technical specifications in detail
2. Create detailed flowcharts of unique processes
3. Gather evidence of invention dates
4. File provisional patent applications

### Short-term (2-4 weeks):
1. Conduct prior art search
2. Refine patent claims with IP attorney
3. Begin trademark registration process
4. Implement additional security measures for trade secrets

### Medium-term (1-6 months):
1. Develop full patent applications
2. Create defensive publications for non-core features
3. Establish IP assignment agreements with all contributors
4. Implement code obfuscation for critical algorithms

### Long-term (6-12 months):
1. File full patent applications
2. Consider international patent filings (PCT)
